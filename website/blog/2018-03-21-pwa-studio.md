Mid march, [our team attended to Reacticon](https://developers.front-commerce.com/blog/2018/03/20/our-reacticon.html), the first
conference about <abbr title="Progressive Web Apps">PWA</abbr> in the Magento
ecosystem.

Since [James] and [Andrew] were to give a presentation, it was a perfect opportunity for us to learn more about PWA Studio. It will impact any Magento developer in the coming years, so we thought you would be interested if we shared a bit of these insights.

## PWA Studio

If you've never heard about it, [PWA Studio is Magento's initiative to bring PWA to the eCommerce world](https://community.magento.com/t5/Magento-DevBlog/Introducing-Magento-PWA-Studio/ba-p/74636). They want to provide you all the tools you need to create your own PWA.

It means that they are creating what developers need to create an eCommerce experience that is:
* **fast** — even with a low end device
* **reliable** — even with a lacky connection
* **engaging** — including responsivness, homescreen button, push notifications

## A new vision

This is actually a huge challenge in Magento's world. Until now, their philosophy was to create a fully configurable product that developers could tweak and customize to their needs. But now, they will only give them building blocks that still need to be assembled yourself.

That's actually awesome news because it means that you will finally be able to get rid of Magento frontend's complexity and use only what you need.

Additionnaly, they won't follow Magento's release cycle as they are part of Magento Research organization. It means that you won't have to wait for the full tool suite to be backed in order to use them.

However, they still want to experiment things internally before releasing them. The upside of this strategy is that early adopters won't have to suffer from too much breaking changes. But, the downside is that few things are public early and it will be harder for them to gather feedback from the community.

## What's available?

Few things are public yet, but among them, several of them are still pretty interesting!

### Peregrine

Peregrine is the set of React Components that any eCommerce React Application will be able to use.

### For Extension Developers

The power of ~~love~~ Magento still comes from its extension points. It's not something they are willing to lose even though they are willing to simplify the frontend's stack.

## What will come next?

Even though they are focusing on tools

That's why they won't create a **base theme** but a **reference theme** that will show how the tools fit together.

## How will it go with FC?

We are willing to collaborate with the core team.

That's why we took the opportunity during the account to contribute. (PR, issues)

Moreover, it was the opportunity to launch a feedback loop and will work even more closely with the PWA Studio's team.

## Conclusion

Our goals are different since we want to provide a full developer suite.
