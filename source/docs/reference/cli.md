With Front-Commerce comes a CLI tool (`front-commerce`) that helps you launch the tasks needed to develop, build and launch your application.

These commands should be launched from your project's root directory. This can be done by:

- Using npm scripts (just like [front-commerce-skeleton/package.json](https://gitlab.com/front-commerce/front-commerce-skeleton/blob/master/package.json#L7))
- Prefixing the commands with `npx` which will call the `front-commerce` bin in your project

## `front-commerce help`

Displays a message referencing the different commands available.

## `front-commerce lint`

This command ensures that your project is correctly linted. This means that it will:

- format your code with prettier
- prevent errors by using eslint rules

In order to configure the rules, please refer to the `eslintConfig` key in your `package.json`.

A basic config could be :

```
{
  "extends": [
    "eslint:recommended",
    "react-app"
  ],
  "plugins": [
    "prettier",
    "security"
  ],
  "rules": {
    "no-console": [
      "warn",
      {
        "allow": [
          "warn",
          "error"
        ]
      }
    ],
    "prettier/prettier": "warn"
  }
}
```

The files linted are the files within the modules you have defined in [`.front-commerce.js`](/docs/reference/front-commerce-js.html). However, the modules that are in `node_modules` won't be linted.

> Please note that the errors and warnings that this tool will log are also displayed when using `front-commerce start` in development mode. The `front-commerce lint` command is mainly useful when you want to ensure that your code is correctly linted before commiting it to your repository.

## `front-commerce prepare`

This command will generate all the files needed to launch a Front-Commerce application. It will use the [`.front-commerce.js`](/docs/reference/front-commerce-js.html) configuration file to know what to generate.

The generated files will be located in the `.front-commerce` folder in the root of your project.

## `front-commerce build`

Before running this command, please make sure to run `front-commerce prepare`.

This command will generate all the compiled files needed to launch your application in a production environment. The generated files will be located in the `build` folder in the root of your project.

Once it is generated, you can launch the application by using `NODE_ENV=production front-commerce start`.

## `front-commerce start`

This command will launch the Front-Commerce application. There are two modes available:

- `NODE_ENV=development front-commerce start`: launches Front-Commerce application in development mode (hot reloading, linting, etc.).  
  Please make sure to have launched `front-commerce prepare` beforehand.
- `NODE_ENV=production front-commerce start`: launches Front-Commerce application in production mode (using precompiled code).  
  Please make sure to have launched `front-commerce build` beforehand.

## `front-commerce styleguide`

This command lets you view your Front-Commerce's components in [Storybook](https://storybook.js.org/).

There are two modes available:

- `NODE_ENV=development front-commerce styleguide`: launches Storybook in development mode (hot reloading, linting, etc.).
- `NODE_ENV=production front-commerce styleguide`: builds the assets of Storybook in `build/styleguide`. The generated files could then be served on any hosting solution supporting static websites.

## `front-commerce translate`

This command checks your translations and adds the missing one to `translations/[lang].json` in the root of your application. See [Translate what's in your components](/docs/advanced/theme/translations.html#Translate-whatâ€™s-in-your-components) for more information.

If some translations are missing, the script will throw an error. This lets you ensure that everything is correctly translated in your CI.

### Options:

- `--ignore-build`: By default, this command will build your application to make sure that no translation is forgotten. However, if you've just run `front-commerce build`, this step is not necessary. `--ignore-build` option is what makes it possible not to build the application during the translation.
